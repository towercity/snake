# Snake
A basic snake game clone, made with instructions from http://www.andrespagella.com/snake-game.
Used to teach myself HTML5 canvas methods of animation and interactivity.

## Instructions
Clone the reposity and open index.html. Use the arrow keys to move. Refresh the page to restart the game.

## To Do:
- Add a resart function to the game over screen
- Add a start screen so the game does not begin immediately
- Make the snake's head a different color to help differentiate it
